- What is code coverage
- Configuring for .NET
- Not covered paths probably hides bugs (no tests)
- Approach:
  - Find usage of not fully covered method/properties and either add tests or configure coverage software to ignore
- Real usage:
  - [SizeofPrimitiveType](https://app.codecov.io/gh/adrianoc/cecilifier/blob/vnext/Cecilifier.Core%2FExtensions%2FTypeExtensions.cs?trend=all%20time#L63)
    - Most likely we don't have tests covering some use case involving arrays.
    - For sure, no coverage fpr Doubles, System.Single (float)
  - [StindOpCodeFor](https://app.codecov.io/gh/adrianoc/cecilifier/blob/vnext/Cecilifier.Core%2FExtensions%2FTypeExtensions.cs?trend=all%20time#L93)
    - Is this even a valid scenario? stind for an array element?
  - Have it uncovered bugs? How many?
